  The Premier League (legal name: The Football Association Premier League Limited) is the highest level of the men's English football league system. Contested by 20 clubs, it operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the English Football League (EFL).
  Seasons typically run from August to May with each team playing 38 matches (playing all 19 other teams both home and away).
  Most games are played on Saturday and Sunday afternoons, with occasional weekday evening fixtures

  Twenty teams are competing in the league – the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the Championship.
  The promoted teams are Fulham, Bournemouth and Nottingham Forest, who return after an absence of one, two and twenty-three years from the top flight respectively.
  The twenty-three years between Nottingham Forest's previous Premier League season and this season is the longest absence for a previous Premier League club in the Premier League era to date.
  They replaced Burnley (relegated after a six-year top flight spell), Watford and Norwich City (both teams relegated after just one year back in the top flight).

  Kevin De Bruyne[pronunciation?] (born 28 June 1991) is a Belgian professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Premier League club Manchester City and the Belgium national team. He is widely regarded as one of the best players in the world and of his generation.[5][6] Pundits have often described him as a "complete footballer".

  De Bruyne began his career at Genk, where he was a regular player when they won the 2010–11 Belgian Pro League.
  In 2012 he joined English club Chelsea, where he was used sparingly and then loaned to Werder Bremen.
  He signed with Wolfsburg for £18 million in 2014, where he established himself as one of the best players in the Bundesliga and was integral in the club's 2014–15 DFB-Pokal win.
  In the summer of 2015 De Bruyne joined Manchester City for a club record £54 million. He has since won four Premier League titles, five League Cups and an FA Cup with the club.
  In 2017–18 he had a significant role in Manchester City's record in becoming the only Premier League team to attain 100 points in a single season.
  In 2019–20, De Bruyne tied the record for most assists in a Premier League season and was awarded Player of the Season (which he won again in 2021–22).
